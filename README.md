# Bit-Burner-Testing
Using Bit Burner to learn JavaScript

# Overview for the Road Ahead
  * This is a work in progress and this file will change over time. 
  * Early Stage Setup TODO List: 
    * Installation and configuration of my workspace environment and development tools.
    * Integrating Bitburner to work or use my project files from my IDE and repositories.
    * Setting up a feasible and extendable javascript/typescript based framework for future works.
    * Exploring more options; potentially setting up a server/database, other language integrations.
  * Internal Code Base Interoperabiity and Potential External Integrations:
    * Integration with NodeJS, P5 framework, and other various tools for web graphics. 
    * Python Integration for potential AI programming
    * C/C++ Integration for backend support for various low level APIs such as DirectX, OpenGL, Vulkan, Cuda, and more.
    * Exploration of other potential language support or bindings such as Rust, Zig, Lua, C# and more.
    * Utilization of WebAssembly and LLVM for smooth and fast translations between various environments and language domains.
